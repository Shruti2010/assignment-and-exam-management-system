1.  Problem Statement In educational institutions, managing assignments,
    exams, and grading manually is tedious and prone to delays. Teachers
    face challenges in tracking submissions and ensuring timely
    evaluations, while students often miss deadlines due to a lack of
    reminders. Administrators struggle to analyze performance trends and
    provide timely interventions. Therefore, there is a need for an
    automated system that centralizes assignment and exam workflows,
    ensures transparent grading, and delivers actionable insights for
    all stakeholders.

2.  Project Overview The Assignment & Exam Management System is a
    Salesforce-based solution designed to assist teachers, students, and
    administrators in streamlining academic workflows. It enables:

-   Students to submit assignments, track grades, and receive
    notifications.
-   Automatic calculation of grades based on exams and assignments.
-   Notifications for upcoming deadlines and exams.
-   Reports and dashboards to track performance and grade trends.

By digitizing these processes, the system reduces manual errors, ensures
accountability, and enhances transparency in academic performance
monitoring.
